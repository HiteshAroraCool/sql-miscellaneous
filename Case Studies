Question 1. We need to understand the behaviour of manufacturing and stocking up of cars to manage the efficiency of
booking.We need to improve the profitability of dealership by decreasing the inventory days. For this we can do either of two
things- Either sell the cars quickly or keep only the relevant cars in the inventory. Let us start analyzing the data by calculating
Model wise Average Inventory days at each dealership by overall model wise average inventory days to see if the model is
stocked up for this particular dealer only or generally has high inventory days.

approach 1:

select *,
case when avg_inventory_days_model < avg_inventory_days_M_D then 'stockup' else 'no dealer stockup' end as dealer_proformance
from (
SELECT 
  model_id, 
  dealer_id,
  AVG(inventory_days) OVER (PARTITION BY model_id) AS avg_inventory_days_model,
  AVG(inventory_days) OVER (PARTITION BY model_id, dealer_id) AS avg_inventory_days_M_D
FROM dbo.car) q;

approach 2:

with Avg_model as (
select Model_ID, avg(Inv_Days) as ave
from Car
group by Model_ID
),
Avg_Dealer as (
select Dealer_ID, avg(Inv_Days) as ave
from Car
group by Dealer_ID
),
select Car.Dealer_ID, Car.Model_ID, Avg_model.ave, Avg_Dealer.ave
from Car, Avg_model, Avg_Dealer
where Car.Dealer_ID=Avg_Dealer.Dealer_ID and Car.Model_ID=Avg_Model.Model_Id;

Question 2. We can also determine the performance of a dealership by calculating Booking and total inventory ratio. (The
Cars in Transit are also in inventory). Rank the dealerships on the basis of this ratio to compare the dealership
performance.Higher the ratio better is the performance

Select *, row_number() over(order by Ratio desc) as rank_Dealers
from (
Select
(count(distinct(Case when Booking_Id is not null then Booking_Id else null end )) as Booking/
count(distinct(Case when Current Status in (‘Transit’,’Inventory’) then Booking_Id else null end )) as Total_Inventory ) as Ratio,
Dealer_ID
* from
Car
Group by Dealer_ID) base;
